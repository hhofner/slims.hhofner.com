I am exploring BiomeJS. I really wish for it to be the final solution to
"linting" and formatting in JavaScript projects.

For some time I was trying to use just eslint, with some opinionated rules. I
don't have too many particular opinions on formatting, just that it's easy to
read, which I find most people's to be, so that's why I look to use other
people's. Unfortunately eslint formatting was not very good, and I often wished
to go back to Prettier. So I guess I do have some opinions.

The reason I chose to not use Prettier, is because I disliked the idea of adding
yet another dependency when eslint, which seemed to be doing the same thing, was
enough.

So, here I am looking at BiomeJS. In particular, I am looking at setting it up
with [Zed](https://biomejs.dev/reference/zed/). It looks to be okay, but now I
have to see what I have done with the config. It has changed quite a bit
[since I last wrote about using eslint to format](https://blog.hhofner.com/blog/eslint-zed).
