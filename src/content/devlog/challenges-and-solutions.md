Ran into some unexpected challenges today with the project. Had to rethink my approach to the data structure. After some research, I found a more efficient solution.

The initial implementation was causing performance issues with larger datasets. I spent a few hours profiling the code and identified the bottleneck. Turns out my algorithm had O(nÂ²) complexity when it could be done in O(n log n).

I also discovered a useful library that handles exactly the kind of processing I need, which will save me a lot of time. Sometimes it's better to use existing solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.

Looking forward to implementing these improvements tomorrow and seeing how they affect the overall performance.
