Check it out to understand more, but basically, InertiaJS uses some tricks to allow you to utilize a SPA framework with your classic backend framework, without having to write an API for it as you typically would. This to me, sounds amazing. I don't have much interest in learning NodeJS (or any of its derivatives) based backends like Hono, or Nest, and have been learning Phoenix for quite some time now. While I am enjoying Phoenix - I am not entirely sold on its frontend solution, LiveView (similarly to the author). So let's see how InertiaJS goes."
