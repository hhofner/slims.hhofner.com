Made significant progress on the project today. Implemented the core functionality and fixed several bugs. The application is starting to take shape.

I spent most of the day working on the backend API, which was more challenging than I expected. Had to refactor some code to make it more maintainable, but I'm happy with the results. The database schema is now finalized and all the basic CRUD operations are working.

Next up is implementing the authentication system and starting work on the frontend. I'm thinking of using a new UI framework for this project to expand my skills.
