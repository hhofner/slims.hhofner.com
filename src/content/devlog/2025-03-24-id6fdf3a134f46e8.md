I guess that's what I get for using ChatGPT. The script that would create an entry in my devlog from the Drafts app would just take the first line and make a slug from it. I ended up with huge slugs. 

So I'm using this small script now to generate IDs for the slug, even though it's not really needed. I do plan to allow to access these devlogs via a link, though.

```javascript
function getSlug(_content) {
	// var slug = content.match(/^slug: (.*)$/m);
	// if (slug) return slug[1];
	// var firstLine = content.split("\n")[0].trim();
	// if (!firstLine) throw new Error("No valid title found");
	// return firstLine.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, "-").replace(
	// 	/^-|-$/g,
	// 	"",
	// );
	return "id" + Math.random().toString(16).slice(2);
}
```
