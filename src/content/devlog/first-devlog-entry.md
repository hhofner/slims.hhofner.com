Started working on a new project today. I'm excited to share my progress with everyone. This is going to be a journey of learning and discovery as I build something new from scratch.

I've been thinking about this idea for a while now, and finally decided to take the plunge. The first step was setting up the development environment and creating a basic project structure. I'm using some new tools that I haven't worked with before, which adds an extra layer of challenge.

Tomorrow I'll start implementing the core functionality and hopefully have something to show by the end of the week.
