Two posts that really stood out to me today are Rach Smiths' [post](https://rachsmith.com/fuck-it/) on _just writing_,
and Nolan Lawson's [post on quitting Twitter](https://nolanlawson.com/2022/02/02/five-years-of-quitting-twitter/). They're not entirely related,
but they really motivate me to work on this blog rather than waste my time on social
networks like Twitter, YouTube and GitHub (just kidding, or, am I..?).

More related to Rach's blog post (which I read from Chris Choyiers [post](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/27/there-is-no-bar/) today, a lot of blogs that I look at always contain amazing, well thought out and very
informative information, giving me a sense of the authors true self: sensible, thoughtful, deliberate...
just to name a few adjectives I pulled from the thesaurus.

But like most things in the web (and corporate world), they are obscured by the
true reality of a human. That's not to say well structured, "good" posts don't say
something about the author, it's just that I think I enjoy reading more "wholesome"
and "real" posts on a daily basis.

Initially I thought I'd work really hard on writing "good posts" for this blog,
but after getting really into RSS feeds and the idea of quitting Twitter overall,
I think I'll pivot to more casual writing, with hopefully things that I've learned
here and there.

Plus, it's just a lot more fun.
