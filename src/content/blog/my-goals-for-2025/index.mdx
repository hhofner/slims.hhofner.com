import BingoCard from "./bingo-card.astro";

Last year I made a list of goals for 2024. This year, I am going to do the same,
but it's going to be a bingo card. Instead of having a list that I tick off
as failed/succeeded, I wanted to have a bit more fun with it. I made 25 different
goals for 2025, (5x5 but one is a freebie), split between 5 different levels
of "difficulty", and shuffled randomly using the date as the seed. I started 
collecting these since last year, so I kind of had most of them prepared. Some
might require context, so apologies if they feel too random.

Without further ado:
