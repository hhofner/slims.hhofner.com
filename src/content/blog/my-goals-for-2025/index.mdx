Last year I made a list of goals for 2025. This year, I am going the same,
but it's going to be a bingo card. Instead of having a list that I tick off
as failed/succeeded, I wanted to have a bit more fun with it. I made 25 different
goals for 2025, (5x5 but one is a freebie), split between 5 different levels
of "difficulty". Without furderado:
