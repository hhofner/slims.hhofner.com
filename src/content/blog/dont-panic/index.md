Somehow Douglas Adam has managed to capture me in a way that I find myself always thinking about something from his books, and as of recent, this fun quote:

> A towel, [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough

While extremely satirical every time I travel I find myself happy to have brought a towel. To add on, you can use it to clean things, use it as a pillow or blanket, dry your hands off when washing (particular important as I don’t like to use the air dryers in the public bathrooms), express yourself if you buy a towel with some motif or team, use it to protect something fragile in your suitcase, and of course, dry yourself :)
