Over the years I've learned about the importance 
of (official) documentation, and in fact it's 
my preferred method of learning something programming
related. 

It's very obvious though, that some frameworks and 
languages' documentation are not all created equal.

This might be a hot take, but I think Python's 
documentation are poor (docs.python.org). Often times,
I have found the documentation for most modules to be
very poorly structured, and it almost felt as if you
had to read the entire documentation page to really 
make any sense of it. An example of what good Python
documentation should be like is from "Real Python"
(https://realpython.com/). Usually I'd go there for a
good overhead view of a particular technique/module, 
then dive into Python's docs. 

But for Python being such a great language for beginners,
I find the documentation not so, and it's a pity 
because beginners should learn to read documentation
as soon as possible in my humble opinion. Unless I'm 
reading the wrong docs, please point me to some more
well structured and clearly written Python docs.

I've been reading and learning some Phoenix LiveView 
recently, and I think for the most part I do appreciate
hexdocs (https://hexdocs.pm/), especially for the main
modules used in Phoenix. 

Another set of docs that I particularly liked reading,
are the Nextjs and Remix docs (https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started and https://remix.run/docs/en/v1 respectively).
Especially the Remix docs, as I really enjoy the aesthetic
appeal of the docs page. Of course it's a bit different
scope and context than Python & Elixir (framework vs language).

To end this post with another side-thought: 
some say the best documentation should be the code, and
more and more I appreciate this when working with JavaScript 
(more specifically Typescript) because I rely heavily
on the language server to point me to the actual source
code of a particular library or node module. I actually 
love this so much, I feel like its been a big hit on my
productivity on my Phoenix/LiveView journey as the 
language server I'm using with Neovim doesn't seem 
to be working as well. 

In any case, let's keep reading docs everyone.
