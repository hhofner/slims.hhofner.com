I've been working with Nuxt for a few weeks now, and was wondering exactly how
the auto imports work. Luckily for me, I found a really nice (free!) resource
on Nuxt that explains exactly how.

[https://learnnuxt.co/free/introduction/nuxt-auto-imports](https://learnnuxt.co/free/introduction/nuxt-auto-imports)

It's essentially a small tutorial that would take you no less than 5-10 minutes.
I recommend it.

I don't know where I stand on auto imports, but as of now at the beginning
of a project, I am certainly enjoying it. It makes files very clean. But I
understand it's a different matter when you end up with 15+ imports. Luckily
though, at that point I think you'd then want to just start doing the imports
explicitly, so really, it feels like there is a best of both worlds here.
