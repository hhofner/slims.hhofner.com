Here are a few pieces of software I've started using and really wanted to share.

## Exercism

I rediscovered a very nice piece of software that I decided to donate to, 
since I've been using it heavily for the past few weeks. That software, or website,
is called [Exercism](https://exercism.org). It's a platform that lets you learn many
programming languages with exercises. The exercises are not 
as ho-hum as just doing LeetCode problems, and the platform has a very nice gamified feel to it all. What I like most about it is that most problems take a good 15-30 minutes depending
on difficulty, and that's just perfect for days that I can't dedicate several hours to
programming, but still want to get my fingers moving a bit.


## Qutebrowser

[A major vurnability was discovered by a security researcher](https://kibty.town/blog/arc/),
and it has been the talk of the town. More worryingly for me though was that I am an Arc 
browser user. Reading this didn't sit well with me, and I thought that yeah, maybe I don't
need to use this, that its features aren't really all that great. 

So I am giving my favorite browser another shot: Qutebrowser. That might sound weird, 
but Qutebrowser has a lot of issues that were hard for me to overcome, but about a week
in, I am feeling hopeful.

## New Reeder

My favorite RSS app came out with its [new version](https://reederapp.com/), and I am loving it. While I find it
unfortunate that its a subscription based product, the pricing is really lovely and I 
don't mind paying for it at that price range.
In truth, I found the older Reeder version a bit difficult to grasp. The UI was nice 
but a lot of the actions were not intuitive to me. This new one feels like its going in
the right direction.
