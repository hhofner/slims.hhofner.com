Tech is fun...sometimes. When I mean tech, I mostly mean talking to people or reading about things *about* tech online is sometimes fun. But it can be a lot.

The thing about tech is that people have opinions. And I have always taken pride in being someone who likes to listen to most if not all opinions, even if they are goofy or ridiculous, at least I get a laugh. But with tech it's no joke. This is further aggravated by the fact that like with many things, it is not black and white.

Take for example a current internal battle that I am having with myself that is fueled by thought published online: the JavaScript vs. anti-JavaScript battle. It's hard to summarize this "battle", but essentially, the deficiency of the programming language has spurred some people to think it is the worst thing in humanity, while others have embraced its shortcomings and propelled it to be the most used programming language in the world.

There are countless articles and videos talking about its faults and how we should move away from it:

People create clever workarounds, and some claim its the fault of capitalism that we are where we are. But at the same time, you could argue that we have never been so empowered as we are now, thanks to the incredible amount of resources in the JavaScript world. Not to mention the business opportunities...

Frankly, I don't know where to stand on this. I enjoy making things with JavaScript, but at the same time, I also believe there is something to be said about its overuse. Hopefully my uncertainty in this regard can improve as my working skill as a software developer improves.
