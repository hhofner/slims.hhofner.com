I've been quite overwhelmed with the amount of tool options one has for personal
productivity and how many of them appeal to me. Taking most of them aside, I'm trying
my best to stick to ones that I am already using, however they are kind of at odds.

About a month and a half ago, I decided to stick to using my [Hobonichi](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/about/)
journal/planner. I decided to do so because of my unwavering addiction to my phone. In the past, I was
a major user of [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). I love the app, and own both the iOS and Mac
version. The issue was that every time I opened my phone to check my tasks, I ended up doing something
else either before or after, and often times would end up wasting several minutes when
I should have closed my phone much earlier. Basically, I want one less reason to look at my phone. Already,
I do feel it has helped quite a bit. Unfortunately, going fully analog has its problems, especially
when working at a tech company that values its digital calendar.

The most recent annoyance of mine is what to do with Obsidian. I love the software,
but find trouble finding a good balance of its usage with my analog planning. While I
treat Obsidian mostly as a location for notes, which is what it initially was meant for,
its "planning features" are hard for me to ignore, and it's entirely too easy to make tasks
that I need to check later.
