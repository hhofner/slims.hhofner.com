There's a true tragedy to listing my goals every year, and that is that I always inevitably list way too much for me to actually accomplish. I'm going to try to keep it a bit more focused this year, but I'm also not going to make any promises. Without further ado:

## Call My Loved Ones Everyday

I try to do this already, but I want to make it a habit.

## 65kg

I don't find myself entirely overweight, but I am at 73kg now, and I've gained about 6kg in the last year (partly due to meniscus surgery). My meniscus and knee are ok, and I'm eating like a triathlete, but not training like one. So 65kg.

## 5 paying users

Maybe a modest goal for some, but it's been a long goal of mine to start my own business. 5 paying users would signify to me that I have it in me, to provide value to people. So this is my career goal for the year.

## 1000 hours

I've been playing classical guitar for a while now, and I'm not getting any younger. I want to get to a level where I can play the pieces I want to play at a very high level, and that means putting in the hours. I'm going to try to get to 1000 hours of practice this year, which is about 2.5 hours a day.

## 16 kyu

I'm not sure about this one, but I've lately been playing a lot of Go (Baduk, 囲碁) and I've thought about trying to get formally rated. 16k is not strong at all, but considering I've only just started, maybe its a worthy goal.

## 12 books (3 in Japanese)

I have many books I want to read. Also I have many books I have bought that need to be read.
