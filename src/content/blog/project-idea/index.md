I typically write project ideas on Obsidian and keep it private. But for some reason,
I wanted to write about this one. Possibly because it is essentially a social network.

## The Idea

A social network for those to share recycling tips.

That's it.

I often find myself thinking, how could I recycle more. What can I do to throw away less, and re-use. A small, example: I often drink ice coffee from [Lawson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_(store)), and instead of always using their cups that I just end up throwing away, I just come with my tumbler and they let me use it! I have read that Family Mart and 7-11 may not let you, but I haven't tried.

Anyways, it's a small thought. I also wonder how many cups I'm saving from using my tumbler.
